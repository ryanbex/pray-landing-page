Privacy Policy\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\f1\fs32 \cf2 Last Modified: January 10, 2017\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\f0 \cf2 Pray is a fast and fun way to share experiences with your friends and the world around you. You can send a photo or video Pray to friends, chronicle your day through Prayer, touch base using Chat, immerse yourself in global events through Live, and enjoy handcrafted stories from the world\'92s top publishers on Discover.\
When you use these services\'97and any others we in the Pray Inc. corporate family roll out, whether in the Pray app or elsewhere\'97you\'92ll share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.\
That\'92s why we\'92ve written this Privacy Policy. And it\'92s why we\'92ve tried to write it in a way that\'92s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just \cf3 email us support@pray.com\cf2 .\
One final point before we dive in: We\'92re happy to report that we participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 Information We Collect\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 There are three basic categories of information we collect:\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl0
\b \cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Information you choose to give us.
\b0 \
\ls1\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Information we get when you use our services.
\b0 \
\ls1\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Information we get from third parties.
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Here\'92s a little more detail on each of these categories.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b \cf2 Information You Choose to Give Us\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0 \cf2 When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Pray account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you\'92d like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.\
Of course, you\'92ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as Prayers and messages to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send Prayers, Chats, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Pray as well: Don\'92t send messages or share content that you wouldn\'92t want someone to save or share.\
It probably goes without saying, but we\'92ll say it anyway: When you contact Pray Support or communicate with us in any other way, we\'92ll collect whatever information you volunteer.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b \cf2 Information We Get When You Use Our Services\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0 \cf2 When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you\'92ve used and how you\'92ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Prayer, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Prays to friends. Here\'92s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services :\

\ls2\ilvl0
\b \cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Usage Information.
\b0  We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:\
\pard\tx940\tx1440\pardeftab720\li1440\fi-1440\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl1\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	
\f2 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
how you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or apply to Prays, which channels you watch on Discover, or which search queries you submit.\
\ls2\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	
\f2 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
how you communicate with other Pray members, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Content Information.
\b0  We collect information about the content you provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.\
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Device Information.
\b0  We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).\
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Device Phonebook.
\b0  Because Pray is all about communicating with friends, we may\'97with your consent\'97collect information from your device\'92s phonebook.\
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Camera and Photos.
\b0  Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device\'92s camera and photos. For example, you won\'92t be able to send Prays or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.\
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Location Information.
\b0  When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.\
\ls2\ilvl0
\b \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.
\b0  Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the \cf3 Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others\cf2  section of our Privacy Policy.\

\b \cf2 Information We Collect from Third Parties\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0 \cf2 We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook\'97and you\'92re one of that user\'92s contacts\'97we may combine the information we collect from that user\'92s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information we collect through our services.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 How We Use Information\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. Here are some of the ways we do that:\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls3\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

monitor and analyze trends and usage.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
contextualize your experience by, among other things, tagging your Memories content using your precise location data (if, of course, you\'92ve consented to us collecting that data) and applying other labels based on the content.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
improve ad targeting and measurement, including through the use of your precise location data (again, if you\'92ve consented to us collecting that data). See the \cf3 Control Over Your Information\cf2  section below for more information about Pray Inc.\'92s advertising practices and your choices.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 How We Share Information\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 We may share information about you in the following ways:\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls4\ilvl0
\b \cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\'95	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

information about you, such as your username, name, and Bitmoji.\
\ls4\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	
\f2 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
information about how you have interacted with the services, such as your Pray \'93score,\'94 the names of Pray members you are friends with, and other information that will help Pray members understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Pray friends in common.\
\ls4\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	
\f2 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook.\
\ls4\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	
\f2 \uc0\u9702 
\f0 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
content you post or send will be shared with other Pray members; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Pray may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your My Prayer content may be seen by any Pray members whom you allow to see your prayers and profile.\

With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition.
\b0  If Pray Inc. gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 We may also share with third parties\'97such as advertisers\'97aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 Third-Party Content and Integrations\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or offer a co-branded or third-party-branded service. Through these links, third-party integrations, and co-branded or third-party-branded services, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on our services. These companies may collect information about how you use our services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.\
Additionally, some companies may use information collected on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b\fs48 \cf2 How Long We Keep Your Content\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\b0\fs32 \cf2 Pray lets you capture what it\'92s like to live in the moment. On our end, that means that we automatically delete the content of your Prays (the photo and video messages that you send your friends) from our servers after we detect that a Pray has been opened by all recipients or has expired. But remember: There are various ways Pray members can save your content and also upload it to Pray (like as an attachment in Chat). We go into more detail below about how users can save Pray content.\
Outside of Pray, the rest of our services may use content for longer periods of time, which means those services may follow different deletion protocols. So, for example, we retain your Prayers content a bit longer than Pray. Or, if you submit content to one of our inherently public features, such as Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service, we may retain the content as long as necessary to offer and improve the services. If you have any questions about how a feature works you can just email us at support@pray.com\
\
Finally\'97and this is important\'97you should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It\'92s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device\'92s temporary storage. Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.

Access and Updates.
\b0  We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we\'92ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the app\'92s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request \cf3 email support@pray.com\cf2  Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request.\

Communicating with other Pray members.
\b0  It\'92s also important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. That\'92s why we\'92ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you\'92d like to receive Prays from just your friends or all Pray members, and whether you\'92d like to block another Pray members from contacting you again.\
